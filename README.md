# features:
The CSS code provided defines the styling for different elements of the quiz application. It sets the background, colors, font family, and sizes of various components.
It also includes styles for the progress bar, buttons, and timer.
JavaScript Logic:
The JavaScript code is responsible for handling the quiz functionality.
It manages the quiz state, tracks the user's score, handles user interactions, and updates the UI accordingly.
It contains event listeners for button clicks, calculates the progress of the quiz, handles correct and incorrect answers, and displays the final score.
It also includes a timer feature that updates the remaining time and ends the quiz when time runs out.
